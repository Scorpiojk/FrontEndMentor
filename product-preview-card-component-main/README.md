# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa).

## Overview

I had learn to code some years ago, but for some reasons I stopped. In these days a friend ask me help in some code and starts to code again
I'm very happy to be coding again, and hopes that likes my work(I don't know if I can host the page, not getting the way).
